<!--

These slides, the code and examples contained within, as well as the fork we've been discussing are all available on GitHub.

My name is Rahul Butani; I'm on the Bazel slack and my email is up on this slide.

Definitely feel free to reach out, very eager to hear what folks think.

With that, I think we have a few minutes for questions (hopefully).
